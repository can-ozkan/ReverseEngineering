Attach Problem
--------------
On many Linux distros, ptrace is restricted by default to avoid debugging other users’ processes.

Check your current setting:


cat /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope
If it's 1 or 2, Frida can’t attach unless the process is a child or you're root.

You can temporarily allow attaching to any process by doing:

sudo sysctl kernel.yama.ptrace_scope=0
